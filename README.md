# Join Equitably the Recognized Queue

Join Equitably the Recognized Queue (jerq for short) is a project that aims to
service JIRA webhooks on issue creation and update. The end goal is that when
issues are created or updated, that jerq's datastore is updated with a running
tally of each requesting team's 'withdrawals' from an ever-growing 'bank' of
time.
